                <h3 class="post-title">How I became a developer in eight months</h3>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Cristina Veale was a technical recruiter before she became a developer.

                        That may not be the most common background for developers, but it gave her

                        an uncommon edge in the job-seeking process. She knew which skills

                        employers were looking for, how in-demand developers were (and still are),

                        and that she didn't need a CS degree to have a programming career.

                        "The harder it was for me to recruit people in IT, the more I realized how

                        low the supply and high the demand was for programmers in the U.S."
                        —Cristina Veale</p>

                    <p>Veale lists the free resources she used, the paid resources she

                        considered, and the meetup groups she went to when she started learning to

                        program. She also describes what a typical day was like and gives readers

                        some tips that she learned along the way.

                        Encouragement for all those learning to code:</p>

                            <p> Michael describes a pivotal time in her life when she was out of

                                funds to pursue a college degree and how she made the decision to leave

                                town and learn programming. In addition to anecdotes, the story shares

                                five strategies and tools that she used to build her programming skills.</p>


                            <p>His account shows us how important it is to struggle through the process

                                of introspection and rediscover your passions.
